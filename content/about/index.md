Hello! Interestingly, I got introduced to programming in my freshman year at [Jaipur Engineering College And Research Centre,  Rajasthan](https://jecrcfoundation.com/) where I completed my Bachelors in Computer Science and Engineering (2016-2020) with [93.9% aggregate](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1wa-FC1DZqAZuVZA-fnRIV6mTviAdnOpr/view?usp=share_link).

My interest in coding started back in 2020 during first year of B.tech . Since then, I started learning programming languages & solving problems based on data structure and algorithms. Most importantly I'm a [Problem Solver](https://leetcode.com/05_akansha/).

Also I've knowledge of Web Development and created some projects on that using HTML, CSS, Javascript / React.js / Node.js, MongoDB and some other cool libraries and frameworks. 
 


Here is a list of the technologies that I'm familiar with!
